# Webpage

The Webpage block specifies that the document content is html, this is important for Web Browsers!

<figure><img src="../../.gitbook/assets/screenshot (5).png" alt=""><figcaption></figcaption></figure>

Output:

```html
<!DOCTYPE HTML>
<html>
</html>
```

## How to use?

<figure><img src="../../.gitbook/assets/screenshot (6).png" alt=""><figcaption></figcaption></figure>

The webpage block is where you're heading, and body content goes inside. While you do not need to have it necessarily it is primarily recommended because of cleanliness!
